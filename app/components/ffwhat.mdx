### Fight for What??

Picture a nation: the People’s Republic of Meaning (PROM). There, society is held together by people's sense of everyday meaning, and the shared practices that citizens do meaningfully, together.

You might like to live in PROM. Seems better than United Conformistan (UC)—where society is held together by ideology and social pressure. And better than in Orgopolis Kingdom (OK), held together by status games, incentives, and bureaucracies.

Of course, real societies are always a mix of these three. Zaibatsu Japan mixed the social pressure of UC with the status games and bureaucracies of OK. Both Soviet Russia and Confucian China smell strongly of UC; Ancient Greece seems close to PROM.

Here’s a theory: societies must hold together somehow. PROM has the preferred social glue, but the other kinds (as in UC and OK) ramp up whenever everyday meaning and shared practices are lost.

When shared meaning and practices break down, ideology and incentives rise.

**I think this is the trend, right now. I won't accept it. I will fight for everyday meaning.**

### The Battlefield

Supposing you’ll join me in the fight, we should survey the battlefield. Why is everyday meaning losing ground? Attacks come from three sides.

**Attack Vector #1: Goals and Hustle.** Life is naturally meaningful—everyday moments, relationships, and acts of creativity often coincide to make an inspired life. But meaning is not distributed equally throughout a life.

Filing taxes, project planning, getting to a hospital—these goal-driven parts of life are important, but aren’t the locus of everyday meaning. You find meaning more in the parts of life you’d slow down and linger on (creative work, time with loved ones, etc) than in the parts you’d accelerate (taxes, the hospital trip).

Those parts you’d linger on can be eclipsed by goals. One big shared goal (like winning a war or putting a man on the moon) can sometimes support everyday meaning; but millions of little goals are bad for it: when life is a maze of checkboxes foisted on us by bureaucracies, or by our overly-goal-driven selves; when all social environments become about getting *through* something; when love is replaced by the goal-driven bureaucracy of dating apps; when similar degradations happen in democracies, science, media, and education.

Many of us respond by “hustling”. Can we get our goals finished faster? Can we get enough money to escape the bureaucracy and hide from the war on meaning? We are trapped.

**Attack Vector #2: Feelings Become Mundane.** Emotions and meaning are closely related. Negative feelings announce what’s meaningful to us and missing; positive ones, what’s meaningful and present. In ideal circumstance, the people around you respond to your feelings, and help you build the shared practices that your feelings point to. This response helps us build meaningful shared practices.

It doesn’t work when people don’ see feelings as revelatory. If they ignore, bypass, tolerate, or “process” them, or just accept them with “equanimity”. Without the signal from emotions, we lose track of what’s sacred in the people around us. We don’t make the practices they need. We come to see one another as objects to bargain with—as possessors of goals or preferences, rather than sacred sources of meaning.

**Attack Vector #3: Universal Norms and Ideologies are Deployed.** After those first two attacks have begun, a third takes over: ideologies arise that say we're all supposed to be one way: charitable like Jesus, good feminists, anti-racist allies, patriots, whatever. People get criticized if they have their own sources of meaning, which aren't political.

These ideological demands mark a society desperately trying to hold itself together using ideologies and social norms. It has become willing to sacrifice the meaning that remains, for a chance of cohesion.

### Banding Together

We cannot defend ourselves against these attacks alone. But—by banding together—we can find a solidarity and defend against the attacks.

The pledge below is meant to protect a group. If members sign it, they can build up everyday meaning and shared practices, bottom-up, within the group. Those groups can network together, and before long we’re in PROM.[1]
