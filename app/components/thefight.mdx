# The Fight for Everyday Meaning

**The strongest societies** are held together by people's sense of everyday meaning and the shared practices which the people do meaningfully together. No society is perfectly like this, but Ancient Greece had some of it; so did the U.S. after World War 2.

Weaker societies are held together by **ideology** and **social roles**. These always come together. Examples are Russia after the Soviet Revolution, and Confucian China. Ideologies and social roles are called upon when the strongest glue—everyday meaning—has been lost.

Still weaker forms of social cohesion also exist—**status games, incentives,** and **bureaucracies** like UBI. These never hold a society together by themselves, but are present to various degrees, especially when everyday meaning is lost.
