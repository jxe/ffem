**Meaning in life.** We often think it’s an individual concern, and a ‘nice to have’. Sitting atop Maslow’s Pyramid. We’ll attend to it once everything else is squared away.

I think this is backwards. Meaning in life isn’t something we can pursue individually, and we can’t defer it. It’s a social thing, and under an immediate threat. We must band together and fight for it.
